# GitLab2023

In this lab, you learned the basics of using GitHub, a popular web-based platform for version control and collaboration. With GitHub, you can store your code, track changes, and collaborate with others on projects.


# Collaborating on a Project

One of the most powerful features of GitHub is the ability to collaborate with others on a project. You can share your code, provide feedback, and work together to solve problems. To start collaborating, you can either create a new repository or find an existing one to contribute to.

When collaborating on a project, it's important to use branches and pull requests. Branches allow you to work on a specific feature or bug fix without affecting the main codebase. Pull requests allow you to submit your changes for review and merge them into the main codebase.

By the end of this lab, you should have a solid understanding of the basics of GitHub and how to use it for collaboration and version control.
